Summary: Initial plan for compiling 10 JS examples to Wasm GC WAT files manually.

# User Prompt
compile 10 js examples to webassembly (use WAT format) using Wasm GC

don't use any other tools or compilers

generate the WAT use your knowledge about compilation

the host of running those compiled wasm provide only simple IO functions (e.g. putchar, getchar)

put the js and wat files into codes/llm_compiler_01

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will create the directory `codes/llm_compiler_01` and manually generate 10 pairs of JS and WAT files. The WAT files will use Wasm GC features where appropriate and rely on `putchar` and `getchar` for IO.
