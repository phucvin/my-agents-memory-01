Summary: Extended `GenericProtoManager` to support all basic protobuf accessors and repeated fields.

# User Prompt
continue on protobuf ufs bridge to support all accessors and test them as well
also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have extended `codes/protobuf_ufs_bridge/generic_proto_manager.h` to support:
- `HasField` and `ClearField`.
- Basic varint types: Bool, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Enum, SInt32.
- Fixed types: Float, Double, Fixed32, Fixed64, SFixed32, SFixed64.
- String and Bytes.
- Repeated fields for all the above types (aggregating both packed and unpacked representations).
I have also updated `codes/protobuf_ufs_bridge/test_main.cpp` with comprehensive tests for all new accessors and verified that they pass. I followed the `AGENTS.md` instructions by logging this interaction.
