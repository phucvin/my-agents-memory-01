Summary: User requested adding a new object example to Static Hermes examples, compiling it to C, and analyzing it. I need to build the `shermes` compiler as it is missing.

# User Prompt
add another object example to hermes example
this one should test adding new field to an object. compile to C, analyze to md (also compare with previous object example)
also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will create `codes/static_hermes_examples/objects_add_field.js`.
I found that `shermes` is missing, so I will attempt to clone and build it from the `static_h` branch as per memory instructions.
Then I will compile the example, analyze the C output, and document it.
