# Agent Response
I have successfully installed the C3 compiler in `/tmp/c3_dist` and created 10 examples in `codes/c3_examples/`.
The examples cover:
1.  Hello World
2.  Variables
3.  Control Flow
4.  Functions
5.  Structs
6.  Arrays
7.  Pointers
8.  Defer
9.  Macros (Generics replacement)
10. Enums

I also created a `run_all.sh` script to execute them and save the outputs to `codes/c3_examples/output/`.
The `README.md` in `codes/c3_examples/` has been updated with the example outputs as required by `AGENTS.md`.
