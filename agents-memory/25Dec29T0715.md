# User Prompt
mention other misconceptions in the demo readme, and why they don't have code example

also inline the demo outputs to each demo section

# Agent Response
I updated `codes/misconceptions_demos/README.md` to:
1.  **Inline Demo Outputs:** Moved the content from the "Demo Outputs" section directly into the corresponding "The Demo" sections for all 7 demos. This improves readability by keeping the results next to the instructions.
2.  **Add Skipped Topics:** Added a new section `## Other Misconceptions (Not Demoed)` listing the topics from the article that were not implemented (e.g., "Optimization gives us optimal programs", "JITs", "LTO timing") and provided a brief reason for each (e.g., theoretical nature, complexity, or ecosystem mismatch).

Verified by reading the file content to ensure correct Markdown structure and content placement.
