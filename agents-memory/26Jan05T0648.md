Summary: Initial plan for verifying JS and WAT implementations in codes/llm_compiler_01 using binaryen.js and node.

# User Prompt
write js code to scan js and wat in llm_compiler_01 folder, run them, compare the output and report

use binaryen js to convert wat to wasm

add readme to llm_compiler_01 to also mention the script

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will:
1.  Initialize a `package.json` in `codes/llm_compiler_01/` and install `binaryen`.
2.  Create a verification script `verify.js` in `codes/llm_compiler_01/` that scans for matching JS and WAT files, runs them (converting WAT to Wasm using binaryen), captures their output, and compares the results.
3.  Add a `README.md` to `codes/llm_compiler_01/` documenting the files and the verification process.
4.  Log this interaction in this file.
