Summary: Implemented a new code demo `05_undefined_behavior` illustrating how Undefined Behavior can both enable (overflow checks) and disable (loop hoisting) compiler optimizations.

# User Prompt
what missed topics in compiler misconception can you write example code for, and if not why

# Agent Response
I identified that the repository lacks a demo for how Undefined Behavior (UB) can *disable* optimizations, specifically loop invariant code motion (hoisting), when the hoisting might introduce UB on a path where it didn't exist (e.g., division by zero).

I implemented:
1.  `codes/misconceptions_demos/05_undefined_behavior/signed_overflow.cpp`: Shows UB enabling optimization (removing signed overflow checks).
2.  `codes/misconceptions_demos/05_undefined_behavior/loop_hoist.cpp`: Shows UB disabling optimization (preventing hoisting of division by zero).
3.  `codes/misconceptions_demos/05_undefined_behavior/Makefile`: To generate assembly.
4.  `codes/misconceptions_demos/05_undefined_behavior/README.md`: Explaining the results.

Verified by inspecting generated assembly:
-   `signed_overflow.cpp` optimized to constant return.
-   `loop_hoist.cpp` retained the division inside the loop guard (safe) vs manual hoisting which moved it outside (unsafe).
