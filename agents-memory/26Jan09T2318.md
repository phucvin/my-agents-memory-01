Summary: Updated tracing JIT benchmarks and documentation.

# User Prompt
run test and update readme with latest numbers

# Agent Response
I created a `benchmark.js` script with the loop counting task, ran the benchmark with and without JIT, and updated `codes/tracing_jit/README.md` with the new performance numbers (4.5x speedup) and an explanation of the new language syntax and instruction set.
