Summary: Implemented demos for "-O3 vs -O2" and "inline keyword" misconceptions. Documented why other topics were skipped.

# User Prompt
scan memory, explain why you didn't write example code for some topics in compiler misconceptions, and if you think you can, write it following the way example codes for some topics are written/explained

also follow agents.md
also keep demo descriptions in the correct section, and run & add demo ouputs for new demos as well

# Agent Response
I implemented two new demos:
1.  **-O3 vs -O2 (`06_O3_vs_O2`):** Used a pointer-chasing linked list traversal to demonstrate that `-O3` does not always outperform `-O2`, especially for memory-bound workloads where vectorization isn't applicable.
2.  **The Role of the Inline Keyword (`07_inline_keyword`):** Used LLVM IR generation to show that the `inline` keyword mainly affects linkage (`linkonce_odr`), acting only as a hint for optimization.

I updated `codes/misconceptions_demos/README.md` with:
-   Descriptions of the new demos in the main section.
-   Actual execution outputs and analysis in the "Demo Outputs" section.

**Reasoning for skipping other topics:**
-   **Optimization gives us optimal programs:** Theoretical concept; hard to prove "non-optimality" with a simple code demo.
-   **Branch weights/Predictors:** Requires inspecting subtle assembly layout differences or hardware counters, which is complex and partially covered by the existing "Branch Prediction" demo.
-   **JIT/Interpreters:** Requires a different ecosystem (JavaScript/Wasm) or complex infrastructure setup, out of scope for this C++-focused repo.
-   **Separate vs Unity:** Already covered by `04_separate_compilation`.
-   **Templates are slow:** Hard to demonstrate effectively without a massive codebase comparison (e.g., D vs C++).
-   **LTO timing:** Relates to build system architecture, not easily demonstrable with simple code.
-   **Target independence of Middle-end:** Requires cross-compilation setup and IR diffing.
-   **Compiler defining UB:** Partially covered by `05_undefined_behavior`.
-   **99% correctness:** Relates to AI/ML generated code, not a compiler feature.
