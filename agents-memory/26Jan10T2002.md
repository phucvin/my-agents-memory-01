Summary: Prototype SSRA (Splitting the atom of register allocation) in C++.

# User Prompt
prototype https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2022-10-04-ssra/ in C++

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will prototype the SSRA algorithm in C++ under `codes/ssra_cpp/`. I will start by understanding the algorithm from the blog post and then implement the necessary SSA IR and the register allocation logic.
