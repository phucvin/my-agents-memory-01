Summary: Added 7 new JS/WAT examples to `codes/llm_compiler_01`.
# User Prompt
add more examples js into llm_compiler_01

adding field to existing object, then access them

polymorphism

5 more medium js examples solving problems

then compile them to WAT (read readme to see how), and run verify.js to confirm they work, also update verify.out

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I created 7 new examples:
1. `obj_field_add`: Demonstrates simulating dynamic field addition in Wasm GC by pre-defining the final struct shape.
2. `polymorphism`: Implements a tagged union approach (struct with a type tag) to handle different shapes (Rectangle, Circle) in a single `area` function.
3. `sum_array`: Iterates over an `(array (mut i32))` to calculate the sum.
4. `is_prime`: Basic primality test using a loop.
5. `fib_iter`: Iterative Fibonacci calculation (contrasting the existing recursive `fib`).
6. `reverse_string`: Reverses a string by allocating a new array and copying characters in reverse order.
7. `collatz`: Calculates the Collatz sequence length using a while loop.

I verified all examples using `verify.js` (using `binaryen` to parse and run the WAT files), and updated `verify.out` and the `README.md`.
