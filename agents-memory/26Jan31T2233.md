Summary: Implementation of a C++ GenericProtoManager that uses `UnknownFieldSet` as a schema-less shared memory container.

# User Prompt
Title: Implementation of a Pure UnknownFieldSet-based C++ Protobuf Bridge (No Reflection)
Objective: Create a C++ GenericProtoManager that uses an empty (schema-less) google::protobuf::Message as a shared memory container. All data must be stored in and retrieved from the UnknownFieldSet. The manager must provide "Safe Accessors" that callers use to ensure physical and semantic data integrity.
Architectural Constraints: No Reflection. Shared Memory.
Requirements: Manual Type-Safe Accessors (SInt64, PackedVarints), Semantic Safety (Oneof, Map), Nested Structures.
Deliverables: C++ class, GTest suite.

# Agent Response
I have implemented the `GenericProtoManager` in `codes/protobuf_ufs_bridge/generic_proto_manager.h` and a comprehensive GTest suite in `codes/protobuf_ufs_bridge/test_main.cpp`.
The implementation features:
- Manual ZigZag encoding/decoding for SInt64.
- Manual parsing of packed varints and nested messages.
- Strict "Last-One-Wins" enforcement using `DeleteByNumber`.
- Oneof safety ensuring sibling tags are deleted.
- Map update logic that scans existing entries, parses keys manually, and removes overwritten entries to maintain uniqueness.
- A GTest suite that verifies all these behaviors.
- A Makefile to build the project.
The project is self-contained in `codes/protobuf_ufs_bridge/` and adheres to the "No Reflection" constraint (using `GetReflection()` only to access the `UnknownFieldSet` itself).
