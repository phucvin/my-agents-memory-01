Summary: Updated the main `codes/misconceptions_demos/README.md` to include the documentation for the new `05_undefined_behavior` demo, replacing the separate README file.

# User Prompt
update the existing readme file in misconceptions_demo instead of creating a new one, also follow its structure to add all relevant sections

# Agent Response
I deleted the `codes/misconceptions_demos/05_undefined_behavior/README.md` file and transferred its content to the main `codes/misconceptions_demos/README.md`. I added a new section "5. Undefined Behavior and Optimizations" following the existing structure (Misconception, Reality, The Demo, Run) and added a "Demo Outputs" subsection with the analysis of the assembly output.
