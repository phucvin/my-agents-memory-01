Summary: Starting task to create `shlang`, a self-interpreting language with C-like syntax and Go-like interfaces.

# User Prompt
The task I need you to solve is the following:
write a language that can interpreter itself

# Agent Response
I have clarified the requirements:
1. Host language: C++
2. Target language: `shlang` (C/JS-like, strong typing, inference, structural interfaces).
3. Goals: Write Host interpreter and Self-interpreter.
4. Specifics: Static analysis, Map implementation in Shlang, no memory freeing needed.

Plan set.
