Summary: Initial session setup. Restoring README.mbt.md in moonbit_examples.

# User Prompt
restore moonbit examples README.mbt.md file
also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I restored `codes/moonbit_examples/README.mbt.md` by recreating it with content derived from the project structure and previous memory logs. I also fixed the `README.md` symlink which was broken. I initialized this session log file and verified the restoration.

# User Prompt
no need to use clang to generate ll file from c, build with '--target all' should generate ll file, but if it doesn't then it's fine

update demo ouputs by running those examples with wasm, wasm gc, native as well and record the execution duration

also when build artifacts, remove all existing files

# Agent Response
I updated the `codes/moonbit_examples/scripts/build_artifacts.py` script to:
1.  Remove the step that uses `clang` to generate `.ll` files from `.c` files.
2.  Ensure `target_artifacts/` is cleaned before building.

I then ran the examples (`hello`, `fibonacci`, `factorial`, `arrays`) with `native`, `wasm`, and `wasm-gc` targets, recording their execution duration.

Finally, I updated `codes/moonbit_examples/README.mbt.md` with:
1.  The new execution output and timing information.
2.  Updated "Build Artifacts" documentation to reflect that `.ll` files are only included if generated by MoonBit (which they currently are not for native targets in this version).

I ran the build script to confirm it generates the expected artifacts (`.c`, `.wat`, `.gc.wat`, `.js`) and skips `.ll` gracefully.
