# Agent Response
I identified `codes/adk_agent` as the target project. I implemented a new `find_and_replace` tool in `src/tools.ts` and registered it in `src/agent.ts`. I also updated `src/run.ts` to verify the functionality, although execution in the current environment faced API/backend errors (400 Tool use with function calling is unsupported). I reverted the test script changes to keep the repo clean but kept the functional changes.
