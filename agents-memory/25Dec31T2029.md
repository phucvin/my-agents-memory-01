Summary: Initial setup for microsandbox Go SDK example.
- The `microsandbox` Go SDK is located at `github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox/sdk/go`.
- The repository URL is `github.com/zerocore-ai/microsandbox`.
- The SDK requires a local server running (`msb server start --dev`), which was not available in the environment.
- Created `codes/microsandbox_example/main.go` to demonstrate creating a Node.js sandbox, writing a JS file, and running it.

# User Prompt
write and run an example using https://github.com/zerocore-ai/microsandbox that uses its go sdk to run commands to write simple js code to file, run with node

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I explored the `microsandbox` repository and found the Go SDK at `github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox/sdk/go`. I created a Go example in `codes/microsandbox_example/main.go` that initializes a Node.js sandbox, writes a `hello.js` file using `echo`, and runs it with `node`.

Due to network restrictions, I was unable to install or start the `microsandbox` server (`msb`), so the example fails with a connection error when run. I have added error handling to the code to explain this dependency. I also followed `AGENTS.md` by logging the session and placing the code in the `codes/` directory.
