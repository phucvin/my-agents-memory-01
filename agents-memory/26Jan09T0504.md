Summary: Prototype an interpreter for a simple language using RPython, benchmark fib(20) with and without JIT, and document results.

# User Prompt
prototype an interpreter for a simple language using RPython

benchmark fib(20) with and without JIT and report the result to the prototype's readme

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will create a prototype interpreter in `codes/rpython_interpreter`, including a parser and JIT support. I will clone the PyPy source code to access the RPython toolchain, compile the interpreter twice (with and without JIT), and run benchmarks. Finally, I will document the findings in the project's README.

# User Prompt
do fib(40) instead

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will update the benchmark to use `fib(40)`, recompile the interpreters, run the new benchmarks, and update the README with the results.
