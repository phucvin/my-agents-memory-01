Summary: Updated the minimal LLM implementation to include a generation prompt for "apple" in addition to existing prompts, and updated the README with the new output.

# User Prompt
run llm_minimal with starting text apple as well and update demo outputs

# Agent Response
I modified `codes/minimal_llm/main.cpp` to include a generation block for the starting text "apple". I then compiled and ran the code, capturing the new output which shows the model attempting to complete the text starting with "apple". Finally, I updated `codes/minimal_llm/README.md` to reflect these changes in the "Example Output" section.
