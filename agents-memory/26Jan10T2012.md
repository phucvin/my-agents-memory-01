Summary: Prototype linear register allocation in Python for SSA input.

# User Prompt
prototype linear register allocation in Python for SSA input

# Agent Response
I will prototype the linear register allocation in Python. I'll start by exploring the `codes/ssa_converters_cpp` directory to understand the expected SSA input format, as that seems to be the source of SSA IR in this repo. Then I will implement the allocator in `codes/linear_scan_regalloc_py/`.
