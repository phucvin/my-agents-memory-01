### User Prompt
I meant how does it work internally

### Agent Response
Here is a deep dive into the internals of Rust polymorphism.

Rust handles polymorphism in two distinct ways internally: **Static Dispatch** (Monomorphization) and **Dynamic Dispatch** (Trait Objects).

### 1. Static Dispatch (Generics) -> Monomorphization

When you use generics (e.g., `fn foo<T: Trait>(arg: T)`), the compiler performs **Monomorphization** (fancy word for "single form").

*   **Compile Time**: The compiler looks at every place you call the function. If you call `foo(Dog)` and `foo(Cat)`, it generates **two separate copies** of the function machine code: `foo_for_dog` and `foo_for_cat`.
*   **Runtime**: There is no decision making. The machine code effectively has hardcoded calls to the specific version.
*   **Pros**: Extremely fast (can be inlined).
*   **Cons**: Larger binary size (code bloat) if used with many different types.

### 2. Dynamic Dispatch (Trait Objects) -> Vtables & Fat Pointers

When you use trait objects (e.g., `fn foo(arg: &dyn Trait)`), the compiler uses **Type Erasure**.

*   **The "Fat Pointer"**: A normal reference in Rust (`&i32`) is a "thin pointer" (just a memory address, usually 64 bits). A reference to a trait object (`&dyn Trait`) is a **Fat Pointer** (128 bits). It contains TWO pieces of information:
    1.  `data_ptr`: A pointer to the actual data (the instance of the struct).
    2.  `vtable_ptr`: A pointer to a **vtable** (Virtual Method Table) specific to that type's implementation of the trait.

*   **The Vtable**: This is a static table generated by the compiler that sits in the program's read-only memory. It contains:
    *   Size and alignment of the concrete type.
    *   A pointer to the `drop` (destructor) function.
    *   A list of function pointers for the trait's methods.

*   **Runtime**: When you call `arg.method()`, the program:
    1.  Follows the `vtable_ptr` to find the vtable.
    2.  Lookups up the address of `method` inside the vtable.
    3.  Calls that function pointer, passing `data_ptr` as the `self` argument.

### Code Demonstration

I've created a file `internals_demo.rs` that proves this by inspecting the size of the pointers.

```rust
use std::mem;

trait Speak {
    fn say(&self);
}

struct Dog;
impl Speak for Dog { fn say(&self) { println!("Woof!"); } }

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;

    // Thin Pointer: Just points to data
    // Size: 8 bytes (64-bit)
    println!("Size of &Dog: {}", mem::size_of::<&Dog>());

    // Fat Pointer: Points to data AND vtable
    // Size: 16 bytes (128-bit)
    let dog_dyn: &dyn Speak = &dog;
    println!("Size of &dyn Speak: {}", mem::size_of::<&dyn Speak>());
}
```

The output confirms that `&dyn Speak` is double the size of a normal reference because it carries that extra vtable information.
