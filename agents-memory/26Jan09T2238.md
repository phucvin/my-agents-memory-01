Summary: Initializing session for prototyping a simple tracing JIT.

# User Prompt
prototype a simple tracing jit

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will prototype a simple tracing JIT compiler in `codes/tracing_jit/` using C++. I will also ensure all actions are logged in this memory file as per `AGENTS.md`.

# Agent Action
Created `codes/tracing_jit/` directory and initialized `README.md`.
Implemented `main.cpp` containing the Interpreter, Profiler, Tracer, and JIT Compiler (x86_64).
Created `Makefile`.
Verified performance: JIT (0.15s) vs Interpreter (3.40s) for 200M iterations.
Updated `README.md` with execution results.
