Summary: Prototype SSA conversion supporting integers, variables, if, and loops.

# User Prompt
prototype converting code to ssa

support integer, variables, if, loop

add test and readme

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will create a prototype in `codes/ssa_demo/` using Python. I will implement a simple IR, CFG construction, and SSA conversion algorithms (Dominance Frontier, Phi insertion, Renaming).
