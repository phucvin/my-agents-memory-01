Summary: Restructured MoonBit examples into separate directories and added build artifacts.

# User Prompt
The user requested to split the MoonBit examples (previously in a single `main.mbt`) into their own directories under `cmd/` so they can run independently.
They also requested to build these examples targeting C, Wasm, and Wasm GC, and copy the generated C files and WAT files (converted from Wasm) into a new directory.
Finally, they asked to update the README to reflect these changes and include instructions for installing the MoonBit CLI, while following `AGENTS.md`.

# Agent Response
I performed the following actions:
1.  **Environment Setup**: Installed MoonBit CLI and `wabt` (for `wasm2wat`).
2.  **Restructuring**:
    *   Split the monolithic `codes/moonbit_examples/cmd/main/main.mbt` into 10 separate packages under `codes/moonbit_examples/cmd/` (e.g., `hello`, `fibonacci`, `traits`, etc.).
    *   Created a `moon.pkg.json` for each new package with `{"is-main": true}`.
    *   Removed the old `cmd/main` directory.
3.  **Build & Artifacts**:
    *   Created a Python script `codes/moonbit_examples/scripts/build_artifacts.py` to automate the build process.
    *   The script builds each example for `native` (C), `wasm`, and `wasm-gc` targets.
    *   It copies the generated `.c` files to `codes/moonbit_examples/target_artifacts/`.
    *   It uses `wasm2wat` to convert the generated `.wasm` files to `.wat` format and saves them in `codes/moonbit_examples/target_artifacts/`.
4.  **Documentation**:
    *   Updated `codes/moonbit_examples/README.md` to document the new structure, installation instructions, and how to use the generated artifacts.
5.  **Verification**:
    *   Verified that the new examples run using `moon run cmd/<example>`.
    *   Verified that artifacts are generated correctly (though Wasm GC conversion failed due to `wasm2wat` version limitations, the script handles this gracefully).

# User Prompt
use flag --output-wat for moonbit examples so no need to call wasm2wat

update targets artifacts to make sure they have WAT for Wasm GC targets

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I updated the build process to rely on MoonBit's `--output-wat` flag instead of `wasm2wat`.

1.  **Build Script Update**:
    *   Modified `codes/moonbit_examples/scripts/build_artifacts.py` to add `--output-wat` when building `wasm` and `wasm-gc` targets.
    *   Removed `wasm2wat` dependency and logic.
    *   Updated the artifact copying logic to find the `.wat` files generated by MoonBit (located in `target/wasm...` and `target/wasm-gc...`) and copy them to `target_artifacts/`.
    *   Ensured Wasm GC WAT files are copied with the `.gc.wat` extension.
2.  **Execution & Verification**:
    *   Ran the updated build script.
    *   Verified that `target_artifacts/` now contains `.c`, `.wat`, and `.gc.wat` files for all examples.
    *   Confirmed that `hello.gc.wat` and others are present, which was previously failing or missing.
