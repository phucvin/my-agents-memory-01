Summary: Prototyped a simple Canvas2D example using the WebCC library. Built WebCC from source (patched for g++). Implemented a bouncing ball demo. Encountered a build issue due to missing `wasm-ld` in the environment, preventing `app.wasm` generation, but successfully generated `app.js` and `index.html`.

# User Prompt
prototype a simple canvas2d example using https://github.com/io-eric/webcc

build and keep the output folders and files

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have created a prototype project in `codes/webcc_canvas_example/`.

The project includes:
1.  **Vendorized WebCC**: I cloned and built the `webcc` library from source (located in `codes/webcc_canvas_example/vendor/webcc`). I patched the build configuration to use `g++` instead of `clang++` to resolve a segmentation fault in the environment.
2.  **Example Code**: `main.cpp` implements a simple bouncing ball animation using WebCC's Canvas2D API.
3.  **Build Output**: The `dist/` folder contains `app.js` and `index.html`.
    *   **Note**: The final `app.wasm` file could not be generated because the `wasm-ld` linker is missing in the current environment. I have documented this in the `README.md`. If you run the build in an environment with `wasm-ld` (part of LLVM/Clang), it should succeed.

You can find the project in `codes/webcc_canvas_example/`.
