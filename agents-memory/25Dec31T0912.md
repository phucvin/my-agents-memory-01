Summary: Successfully built Static Hermes from source and used it to compile simple JavaScript examples (`hello.js`, `math.js`) to C code (`hello.c`, `math.c`). Documented the process in `codes/static_hermes_examples/README.md`.

# User Prompt
follow https://devongovett.me/blog/static-hermes.html to compile some simple js examples to C, and keep the C files

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have completed the task.

1.  **Workspace Setup**: Created `codes/static_hermes_examples/` containing `hello.js` and `math.js`.
2.  **Build Static Hermes**: Cloned the `hermes` repository (branch `static_h`) into `codes/hermes_build`. Configured the build with `HERMES_UNICODE_LITE=ON` to successfully compile without external ICU dependencies in the sandbox.
3.  **Compilation**: Used the built `shermes` binary to compile the JavaScript examples to C:
    *   `hello.js` -> `hello.c`
    *   `math.js` -> `math.c`
4.  **Documentation**: Created `codes/static_hermes_examples/README.md` detailing the build instructions and usage.
5.  **Memory**: Recorded the build configuration and usage details in agent memory.
