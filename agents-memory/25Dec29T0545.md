Summary: Executed the compiler misconceptions demos, verified the results, and updated the README with the outputs.

# User Prompt
run misconceptions_demos and report outputs to its readme

# Agent Response
I executed the demos in `codes/misconceptions_demos/`:
1.  **Data Locality**: Ran a benchmark comparing Array of Structs (AoS) vs Struct of Arrays (SoA). Found that without aggressive inlining, SoA was significantly faster, confirming the misconception that the compiler does not automatically fix data layout.
2.  **Inlining**: Generated LLVM IR to show that inlining enabled constant propagation (eliminating a division check).
3.  **Branch Prediction**: Generated assembly to show that `__builtin_expect` reorders basic blocks for fall-through efficiency.
4.  **Separate Compilation**: Verified that a "Unity Build" was significantly faster than separate compilation.

I appended these results to `codes/misconceptions_demos/README.md` and cleaned up the build artifacts.

# User Prompt
also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I read `AGENTS.md` and identified the requirement to log the session in `agents-memory/`. I created this file (`25Dec29T0545.md`) to document the session interactions.
