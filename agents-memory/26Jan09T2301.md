Summary: Improved tracing JIT to support a dynamic language with a parser.

# User Prompt
improve tracing jit prototype to parse and run a simple dynamic typed language

# Agent Response
I have updated `codes/tracing_jit/` to include a `Parser` class and a `tokenize` function, allowing the execution of a simple dynamic language (variables, while loops, print, basic arithmetic). I refactored the VM to use a `Value` struct (tagged union) for dynamic typing and expanded the register file to 256 "virtual registers" stored in memory, which the JIT accesses via memory operands. I also added a `MOV` opcode to correctly handle assignments and verified the implementation with test scripts.
