Summary: Refactored `minimal_llm` to be more accessible to software engineers by renaming variables/classes to descriptive names and adding detailed comments explaining AI concepts. Updated README with high-level explanations.

# User Prompt
comment minimal_llm and potentially rename things so that software engineers who don't have good background in math and AI can still understand
also update readme and follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have refactored the `codes/minimal_llm/main.cpp` file to make it more readable for software engineers.
Key changes include:
1.  **Renaming**:
    -   `wte` -> `token_embedding_table`
    -   `wpe` -> `position_embedding_table`
    -   `c_attn` -> `key_query_value_projection`
    -   `Block` -> `TransformerBlock`
    -   And many others to be self-explanatory.
2.  **Commenting**: Added detailed comments explaining *what* each component does (e.g., Attention, Layer Norm, Backpropagation) in software engineering terms.
3.  **README**: Updated `codes/minimal_llm/README.md` with an "Overview for Software Engineers" section mapping AI concepts to CS concepts (e.g., "Tensors are just Arrays", "Forward Pass is Execution").

I also verified the changes by compiling and running the model, ensuring it still overfits the training sentence correctly.
