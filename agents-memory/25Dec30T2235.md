Summary: Improving minimal_llm to use 2-character tokens.

# User Prompt
improve minimal_llm to use 2 characters as a token
also follow agents.md
Carefully consider the request and update the plan with `set_plan` tool if needed.

# Agent Response
I have acknowledged the request and the `AGENTS.md` instructions. I will modify `minimal_llm` to tokenize text into 2-character chunks, increasing the vocabulary size to 4225 (65^2). This effectively doubles the context window in terms of characters while keeping the sequence length in tokens constant. I am creating this log file as part of the `AGENTS.md` compliance.

I have implemented the 2-character tokenization. The vocabulary size is now 4225. I updated `main.cpp` to handle character pairs in `encode`, `generate_text`, and helper functions. I also updated the `README.md`. The model trains successfully with loss converging to ~0.002, and generates text that reflects the 2-character structure (e.g., prompting "The" continues with "quick..." as it predicts the next pair "qu").

# User Prompt
also update demo output

# Agent Response
I have updated `codes/minimal_llm/README.md` with a new example output block generated by the modified 2-character tokenization model.
