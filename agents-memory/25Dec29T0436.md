Summary: User asked for explanation and example code for "Common Misconceptions about Compilers". Created demos for Data Locality, Inlining, Branch Prediction, and Separate Compilation. Moved code to `codes/` directory as requested.

# User Prompt
explain and write example code to help me understand https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/common-misconceptions-about-compilers.html

# Agent Response
I am creating a set of C++ examples (`misconceptions_demos/`) to illustrate the key points from the article.
1.  **Data Locality**: Showing AoS vs SoA performance.
2.  **Inlining**: Showing how inlining enables constant propagation.
3.  **Branch Prediction**: Showing how `__builtin_expect` affects block layout.
4.  **Separate Compilation**: Comparing Separate vs Unity builds.

I will verify these demos and ensure they demonstrate the concepts correctly.

# User Prompt
move prototypes, demos, codes to under codes directory

also update agents.md to always do this in the future

# Agent Response
I have moved `misconceptions_demos` to `codes/misconceptions_demos`.
I have also updated `AGENTS.md` to instruct future agents to use the `codes/` directory for such files.
