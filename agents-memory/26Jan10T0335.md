# Agent Response
I have successfully rerunning the `adk_agent`.
1.  Installed dependencies (including patching `@google/adk`).
2.  Ran the agent with the default prompt: "create hello.txt containing some text and files.txt containing the files in the parent directory".
3.  Verified that `hello.txt` and `files.txt` were created in `codes/adk_agent/sandbox/`.
    -   `hello.txt`: "Hello, this is a test file created by the file_agent."
    -   `files.txt`: "hello.txt" (listing the sandbox content).
