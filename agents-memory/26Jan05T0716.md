Summary: Update llm_compiler_01 README to clarify LLM-generated WAT files.

# User Prompt
update llm_compiler_01 readme to mention the wat files are compiled by LLM, not a normal compiler

LLMs would read the source js file, and uses it knowledge about compilation to generate WAT using Wasm GC features

verify.js is ran to make sure the generated WAT is working similar to the js one

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
Updated `codes/llm_compiler_01/README.md` to clarify that WAT files are generated by an LLM. Verified that all tests pass using `verify.js`.
