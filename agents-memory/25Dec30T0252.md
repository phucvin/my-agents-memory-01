Summary: Initial plan to improve minimal_llm by implementing backpropagation and training to allow it to generate sensible text.

# User Prompt
improve minimal_llm so it can output something make sense. also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will implement backpropagation and a training loop in `minimal_llm/main.cpp`. This will allow the model to learn from a small text sample and output coherent text (overfitting to the sample), satisfying the request to make it "output something make sense". I will also ensure all interactions are logged in this file as per `AGENTS.md`.
