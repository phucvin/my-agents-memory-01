# Coding Experiments and Demos

## Live Demos
- [**GitHub Page**](https://phucvin.github.io/my-agents-memory-01/)
- [**WebCC Canvas Example**](https://phucvin.github.io/my-agents-memory-01/codes/webcc_canvas_example/dist/)

This repository serves as a playground for various coding experiments, language prototypes, system emulations, and compiler projects. It contains a diverse collection of examples exploring low-level systems, programming language design, and AI integration.

## Overview

The `codes/` directory contains independent projects covering several key areas:

### 1. Compilers and Interpreters
Explorations into how code is parsed, compiled, and executed.
- **LLM-driven Compilation**: Experiments using LLMs to compile high-level code (JS) into WebAssembly.
- **Static Analysis**: Examples involving Static Hermes and JS-to-C compilation.
- **Custom Languages**: Implementations of experimental languages (`silang`, `shlang`) and examples for emerging languages like MoonBit and C3.

### 2. AI and LLMs
Projects building or integrating with Large Language Models.
- **Minimal LLM**: A didactic C++ implementation of a Transformer-based LLM.
- **AI Agents**: Minimal agents interacting with APIs (Gemini) and tools.

### 3. Systems and Sandboxing
Work related to isolation, emulation, and secure execution environments.
- **Sandboxing**: Integrations with sandbox environments via MCP (Model Context Protocol) and custom SDKs.
- **Emulation**: Running Linux kernels and x86 environments within Node.js (v86).
- **Performance**: Demonstrations of C++ optimization misconceptions and compiler behaviors.

## Usage

Each project within `codes/` is self-contained. Please refer to the `README.md` within each specific subdirectory for installation and usage instructions.
